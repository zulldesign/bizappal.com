To add a new reseller TLD domain to your reseller acocunt is easy, you can add unlimited reseller domains for free:

Once you add a reseller domain it becomes a free hosting website where users can register for free hosting at it (with a pre-installed template which you can edit).

Your new reseller domains must have the name servers to :

ns1.byet.org
ns2.byet.org
ns3.byet.org
ns5.byet.org

Or this is OPTIONAL you can register the following IP addreses to ns1.yourdomain.com and ns2.yourdomain.com, then use these name servers.

ns1 : 198.251.86.152
ns2 : 198.251.86.153

Then add them to your reseller panel using the ADD RESELLER function.

Many veteran resellers frequent the http://byet.net forums, if you have any questions please register here and try posting in the 'MyOwnFreeHost.net' sub forums.
